Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'concerning' with 'disconcerting'


Note that there are forks of a similar extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt', etc.. but I think it's also important to replace concerning with disconcerting; as far as I know that doesn't exist yet. Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with concerning URLs. Thank you for your disconcert.
